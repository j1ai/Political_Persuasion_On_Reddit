I expect with more traning examples, the accuracies of the classifier will increase, as more features can be extracted from 
the training examples to better fit the model. Also, I expect the accuracies of the selected classifiers are increasing 
until it reaches its optimal accuracy and the accuracy after its optimal state will decrease, 
as more training examples will cause the classifier to produce a overfitted model. 

From 1K of data to 15K of data, the accuracies are increasad by 7% and the classifier reaches its optimal accuracy at 15K 
as the accuracy for 20K of data has been slightly decreased by 0.2%. 
Overall, the reported accuracies are matched with my expectations, as the classifier is trained with more edge cases 
and scenarios such that it would provide a better prediction at its optimal rate.
